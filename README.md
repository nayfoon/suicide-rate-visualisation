# Suicide-Rate-Visualisation
Interactive Data Visualisation in JavaScript using D3

Exploration of suicide rates over the regions of United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, United
States, and France. Data sourced from The World Health Organisation’s 2014 published report,
‘Preventing Suicide: A Global Imperative.’

This design allows for the users to have more precision in the data that they
are viewing – providing users with the ability to hover over the variables, viewing the
year and its index value. As for the more standardised factors of the visualisation, each region is
colour coded to their association. The variable lines are also made visibly thin, this is due to
the multiple crossovers that each variable experiences, allowing for users to have a more precise
definition of a given variable.

When understanding this visualisation, it is best done with a view of skepticism; while to some
degree the dataset outlines the key years of higher suicide rates, it unfortunately does not dictate
the full reasons as to why. We can see that France is always at highest rate,
reaching a peak of 19.47. Upon further research, France is commonly compared to United
Kingdom which possesses the lowest of all presented regions, having their lowest rate reach 6.01.
It is believed to be that France severely lacks when it comes to suicide prevention schemes. The
first plan to help prevent suicide for the United Kingdom was initiated back in 1950 while France
only saw the prevalent plans in the year 2000. As for Australia, the highest rate reached was 16.36
in 1963. It was believed that this gradual increase, post-World War 2, was in part due to the made
availability of seductive and hypnotic drugs. It was only after 1968 that the suicide rate remained
stable at a rate of 12 per 100,000.

When reviewing the suicide data as a whole, it's believed that around 800,000 people die due to
suicide per year, meaning every 40 seconds holds the casualty of another committed suicide.
Unfortunately, for the sake of this visualisation, we can never accurately determine the basis for
suicide as each are individual in nature, but we can recognise that these are related to a mental
health condition.
